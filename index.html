  <p class="left rule-list"> <strong>Hello and WELCOME!</strong> 
    <br/> 
    If you would like to play Sketch-N-Guess there are a few things to go over before you can begin.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. ____This is a <strong>TWO</strong> player game, so grab a friend! 
    <br/>
    2. ____Each player will take turns either drawing or guessing, while one is drawing the other player should look away for the screen for the first five seconds while the drawer gets their clue. 
    <br/>
    3. ____After the clue disappears, the drawing player should start to draw and the guessing player can begin to guess! You only have 30 seconds to draw so think fast! 
    <br/>
    4. ____You can choose your color on the side! 
    <br/>
    5. ____If the guessing player guesses correctly press the green CHECK mark, and they get a point. If the picture is not guessed, no one gets a point :( But don't worry you can play again! This time the drawing player from round one will guess! 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    HAVE FUN! </p>
