  <h3 class="left subheading"> If you would like to play Sketch-N-Guess there are a few things to go over before you can begin.</h3>
  <p class="left rule-list"> 
    <br/> 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. ____This is a <strong>TWO</strong> player game, so grab a friend! 
    <br/>
    2. ____Each player will take turns either drawing or guessing! Enter your names to the right and hit "Ready!". Then follow the instructions on the next screen to begin! 
    <br/>
    3. ____While one is drawing the other player should look away for the screen for the first five seconds while the drawer gets their clue. 
    After the clue disappears, the drawing player should start to draw and the guessing player can begin to guess! You only have 60 seconds to draw so think fast! 
    <br/>
    4. ____You can change your color at any point by clicking the color box again.
    <br/>
    5. ____If the guessing player guesses correctly press the green CHECK mark, and they will receive 10 points. If the picture is not guessed, the artist looses TEN POINTS! But don't worry you can play again! This time the drawing player from round one will guess!
